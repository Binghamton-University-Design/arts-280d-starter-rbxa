				<h1>New Glitches in the Matrix</h1>
				<h2>By Emma Brewer / <em>June 5, 2020</em></h2>

				<p><span>W</span>hile cleaning your dirty clothes, you are haunted by the sensation of having cleaned all these same clothes before—perhaps infinite times.</p>

				<p>You finally decide to go running, and jog a gruelling five miles, but MapMyRun only logs half a mile. Strange!</p>

				<p>Your child has reached a new tantrum-frequency rate of one tantrum per minute, yet each tantrum is approximately twenty minutes long. The math... it doesn’t add up.</p>

				<p>You awake in a cold sweat at 2 a.m., remembering the time you said “Owen Wilson” when you meant to say “Wilfred Owen.” Before you know it, morning has arrived.</p>

				<p>No matter how often you hit the thumbs-down icon, Red Hot Chili Peppers songs keep popping up on your Tina Turner Spotify station.</p>

				<p>Having finished peeing, you now have to pee again. You’re still just sitting there on the toilet, staring at your phone. So that’s fine.</p>

				<p>It’s Wednesday. But last week? Also Wednesday.</p>

				<p>You’re still washing your hands when it becomes time to wash your hands again.</p>

				<p>You awake in a cold sweat at 2 a.m., remembering the time you said “Hieronymus Bosch” when you meant to say “Thelonious Monk.” Boom! It’s morning.</p>

				<p>Abruptly, you recall that the former WrestleMania villain and serial golf cheater Donald Trump gets to decide if billions of people live or die. This feeling is sickening and familiar, as though you’ve had the same abrupt realization before, perhaps hundreds of times a day, for years.</p>

				<p>Facebook shows you an ad that reads “Want to stop waking up in a cold sweat?” <em>mere moments</em> before you think, I want to stop waking up in a cold sweat. Spooky!</p>
